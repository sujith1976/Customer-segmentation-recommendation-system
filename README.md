In this project, we explore the burgeoning field of online retail through a comprehensive analysis of transactional data from a UK-based retailer, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset, which captures transactions over a one-year period from 2010 to 2011, serves as a foundation for enhancing marketing effectiveness and driving sales growth through customer segmentation. Our primary objective is to reformat the transactional data into a customer-centric framework by engineering new features that allow us to identify distinct customer profiles.

Leveraging the K-means clustering algorithm, we categorize customers into various segments based on their purchasing behaviors and preferences. This segmentation enables us to understand the unique characteristics of each customer group, providing valuable insights into their preferences and buying patterns. Building on these insights, we develop a recommendation system tailored to each segment. This system suggests top-selling products to customers who have yet to purchase these items, ultimately optimizing marketing strategies and boosting sales. Through this data-driven approach, our project demonstrates the potential of customer segmentation and targeted recommendations to strengthen customer relationships and maximize retail performance.
